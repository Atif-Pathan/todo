# restaurant-page

### **Check it out: https://atif-pathan.github.io/restaurant-page/**

Practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage! By the end, I will be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website. And also utilize Webpack module bundler.

One thing I tried to do on this project was make the website slightly more responsive, mainly for desktop and laptop screens. It still isnt perfect and I would like to improve on that in the future!
